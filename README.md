## Introduction

BrightBell is a full stack alarm app that allows users to create custom alarms to ensure that they are on time for whatever life throws at them. Users can choose from a curated list of tones and label their alarms as they see fit.

## Live Demo

Check out Alarm Mate [here](https://alarmmate.netlify.app/).

## Planning Materials

For the planning of Alarm Mate, we created an ERD chart, wireframes, a routing chart and user stories. Planning materials can be found here on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/A0aIpfsD/alarm-application)

- Snooze - users can enable a snooze function whenever they need a little bit more time
